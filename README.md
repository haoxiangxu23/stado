# Spatio-Temporal Action Detection with Occlusion

> Pytorch implementation of [Spatio-Temporal Action Detection with Occlusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nt8--NZlHI).
> 
> Take [Actions as Moving Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04608) (MOC) as the baseline model.

<br/>

## Overview  

![architecture](/readme/architecture.png?raw=true)

STADO is decomposed into one module and three crucial head branches:
- (1) [**Mask-Guided Attention Module**](readme/mga.png)

  Produced a spatial attention mask to modulate features generated by the backbone to focus on non-occlusion patterns.

- (2) [**Multi-Task Branches** ](readme/branches.png)

  Realized action detection and recognition.

  (a) **Center Branch** for center localization and action recognition.

  (b) **Movement Branch** for movement estimation at adjacent frames to form moving point trajectories.

  (c) **Box Branch** for spatial extent detection by directly regressing bounding box size at the estimated center point of each frame.
